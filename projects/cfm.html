            <h3>problem/goal</h3>
            <p>our goal for the community farmer’s market was to find a way to increase consumer to vendor communication so that vendors can benefit from consumer feedback.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="research" class="content">
            <h3>research</h3>
            <p>we initially went to the Grant Park Farmer’s Market to get some ideas as to what our problem space could be. After talking to Myriam, owner of Raw Head Bread, we got the indication that vendors and consumers had virtually no ideal method to communicate. As a whole, we observed that vendors had to hand out their email manually to communicate with consumers, consumers did not have an easy way to communicate with vendors without verbally speaking to them, and communication between vendors and consumers was lacking in such way that hindered vendor growth.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>some existing resources for communication:</b><br>
                <b>google reviews:</b> vendors are able to see and respond to comments/concerns regarding their product. This resource is also impersonal, requires intentional effort on the customer side, which could discourage interaction of the platform and deprive the vendor of feedback. customer is also not directly responding to the vendor but rather the product, which can facilitate ineffective feedback. <br>
                <b>facebook:</b> facebook groups allow vendors to communicate with each other. the current CFM facebook group is not used as a communication of engagement platform, but rather to hire new workers or post general announcements. This resource is weak as it has allowed for inactivity and requires regular engagement on all vendor parts in order to be an effective form of communication.<br>
                <b>square:</b> vendors are able to indirectly interact with consumers through sales data. This model breaks when it comes to consumers who do not buy regularly or show interest but do not make a purchase. This platform allows for gaps in assessment of consumer tastes because it does not provide any feedback regarding the consumers opinions of the product.<br>

            <h3>the idea</h3>
            <p>we came up with three ways to encourage involvement of both stakeholders and increase communication between them:</p>
            <ul id="solution">
                <li>a list of farmers markets to search for vendors</li>
                <li>provide an interactive map for customers to easily locate vendors during, before, or after the market.</li>
                <li>allow customers the opportunity to fill out feedback forms and leave ratings that the vendors can review.</li>
