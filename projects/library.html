            <h3>problem/goal</h3>
            <p>The main subject of the research is Digital Divide focusing solely on this issue within the environment/ecosystem of libraries situated in Malmö city. Digital divide is “the economic, educational, and social inequalities between those who have computers and online access and those who do not”. This definition was a foundation to the research to find out how the digital divide occurs in the libraries, specifically in the city of Malmö. The aim of this research was to define the problem regarding the digital divide and propose potential design opportunities areas and further plans for developing the project. </p>

                    <p><b>desk research:</b><br> Before meeting with library representatives, desk research was conducted to gather basic knowledge about the impact digital divide has on the library regarding the accessibility of legal information. As mentioned above, the public library is not only a tool that provides the opportunity to read books and get access to technology, but also a middleman between the government and the people that allows the people to receive and handle legal information. Especially in times of crisis, the library offers the accessibility of information regarding current situations and updates in urgent government orders for those who do not have access within the safety of their own homes. 74% of people over the age of 16 use their digital community service and internet to receive information about tax agencies, and 53% of people of the same age group use their technology community for healthcare services. Legal information or instructions like this used to only be offered to the public in a physical format. However, there is a rising prevalence of public legal documents in electronic form, since the Swedish government, in the 1970’s, accepted electronic documents to have the same status of being originals as printed documents. To serve these people who seek news or factual information but do not have the access or ability to use technology devices, libraries provide the general public with both printed and electronic information.</p>

                    <p><b><br> interviews:</b><br> 
                        Within service design, accurate representation of users’ opinions is crucial. With this idea in mind, multiple interviews were conducted with library officials, as service providers, and library users, as service users.
                    <br>In the process of user interviews, 5 people were interviewed in the format of video/voice call- ing and on-site interview. All interviewees were not of Swedish origin, to get a more specific insight on the difficulties people face regarding language barriers. While most interviewees were fairly confident in their skills in technology, they did express the challenges they face because of the lack of variety in language at public institutions. Similar to the comments made by the librarians, the library users also expressed confusion and stress regarding the usage of printers. Having to use two cards, instructions only in Swedish, and the complexity of the procedures itself were the main issues they have highlighted.

                    <p><b>field work:</b><br>
                        Along with desk research and interviews, a work-flow experi- ment was run in the city library in Malmö. One of the members of the team went to the library with the goal of uploading, printing, and scanning documents, in an attempt to mimic a library user trying to handle legal documents in the library. The purpose of this walk through was to experience the procedure that the user has to go through to successfully and safely complete the goal and what feels the user goes through whilst this process.</p>

                <li><b>How might we simplify the process of handling official documents, taking in account non Swedish speakers?</b><br>
                    The types of documents and forms that people find most difficult to handle are related to some governmental agencies such as Migrationsverket and Skatteverket. The language used in such documents is not easy to understand even to people who speak intermediate to higher levels of Swedish. Asking a librarian, a friend or strangers via Facebook groups are the most common actions taken to solve such hassles, as show in In addition to the advanced language used, the value an intolerance of mis- takes of those forms contribute to making a difficult process.

                <li>
                    <b>How might we improve the printing service and its guidelines?</b><br>
                    This process is time-consuming due to the need to navigate back and forth between the reception, computers and printers. Having to obtain and use two different cards and accounts does not make the process any easier. In addition, the instructions are all in Swedish and are not placed in the right place in most cases. When the user overcomes all of those obstacles, they still need to endure the complicated software used on the library’s computers. Using this system requires logging in with two different accounts, one of them has the Copy Card number as its username and password, which is not stated clearly. Moreover, printing in color is difficult to perform even for someone with advanced computer skills.

                    <b>How might we build a community in which library users can support each other with their knowledge, experience, and expertise?</b><br>
                    Requesting assistance from others is a common approach that users used to overcome a lot of their frustrations that are related to language issues, sending forms and printing. Those issues are being taken to the librarians in case no other support is available. Otherwise, the assistance can come from anyone who’s fluent in Swedish, experienced with computers or have gone through the same processes before. Those people who offer the support may be friends, relatives, coworkers or even strangers found on some social Facebook groups.

            <h3>the idea: library community platform</h3>

                The Library Community Platform is a service connecting persons that need help with digital tools and those who can provide it. Its main element is a digital platform meant as an application that can be accessed from any digital device, such as smartphone and computer. Additionally, the service includes physical meeting points within the library where the physical meetings between different stakeholders take place. By not limiting the service to onlythe digital platform, users who are not able to use it can still receive the help they need by getting connected to the persons who can provide that help to them through the librarians.In that way the Library Community Service aims to include all the users, from digitally skilled to digitally excluded, who struggle with digitally demanding tasks because of the digital divide. The service helps in building and strengthening a self-reliant library community and local solidarity.

            <h3>what's next?</h3>
            <p> At this critical stage of development and iteration, the Community Platform has factors involving the success in the ability to instantiate and continue the service that need to be discussed: <br>
                <b>First is that the inclusion of the digitally incapable is still limited.</b> The platform itself is a channel for those who are struggling to easily reach out for help, but lacks the comprehensive inclusion of all members of the community and those who lack technological skills, along with in-person support to additionally aid in the social and digital inclusiveness. the act of actively exposing and encouraging the digitally incapable to digital solutions through collaborating with non-profit organizations would decrease the sense of distance towards digitalism. Non-profit community-based organizations can be especially effective in reaching hard-to-serve populations, and are more nimble and experienced in interacting with people. Likely partners for community-based organizations are nonprofits that serve targeted populations within a community, such as, but not limited to, low-income or homeless, populations with disabilities, and people from specific ethnic groups. <br>
                <b>Another factor that needs to be discussed is the issue of validating and training volunteers.</b> The question, ‘how can we make sure our volunteers are reliable, in terms of specialized skills?’ needs to be asked. Problems with availability of the volunteers and accuracy of the information can rise as more users start utilizing the service.Possible implementations to improve this issue could be to recruit specialized workers to be part of the volunteer group. As community members, company staff in each category of digital issues could either support or become a volunteer to help those in need. In this way, the accuracy and precision of the information distributed is validated.</p>
