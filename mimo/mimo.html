                <h5>Foreword</h5>
                <p>This is a passion project exploring interactive prototyping ideas. <br> 
                    This project is split into two iterations, 
                    each exploring two different uses of sound and how they can be 
                    re-defined with components of light.</p>

            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h5>The Question</h5>
                <h3><b>Re-defining everyday objects</b></h3>
                <p>Sound, in the form of an alert, is definitely not a pleasing tone to hear. 
                    I wanted to explore an opportunity here: how can I replace an unattractive 
                    component of sound with something else to alert and send information?</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- MILO -->
        <div class="row py-5 border-bottom m-auto">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h3><b>milo: re-defining an alarm clock</b></h3>
                <p><b>Loud sounds in alarms are unpleasant:</b>
                    How can we replace something loud and unpleasant with soft and nuanced?
                </p>
                <p><b>Light is often therapeutic and lifts up the mood:</b>
                    Can light replace sound in communicating with the user?
                </p>
                <p>milo is an alternative interpretation of an alarm clock. 
                    At first glance, milo looks and acts like a desk lamp. 
                    However, once you press on milo, it activates an alarm which alerts you 
                    with a change of hue in light.

        <!-- MIMO -->
        <div class="row py-5 border-bottom m-auto">
            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h3><b>mimo: re-defining an IoT device</b></h3>
                <p>
                    This iteration focuses on transforming more complicated numerical data into variations of light. <br>
                    Based on the time of the day, mimo’s appearance changes, as if it is breathing! <br>
                    The weather is shown through the color of light or as one might say, mimo’s mood. <br>
                    mimo recognizes your hand gestures and responds to you accordingly. mimo says hello! <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    mimo takes the most used function in an IoT device, the weather service, to share information. 
                    Like milo, mimo looks like a lamp at first glance. 
                    However, mimo does much more. mimo takes numerical data such as, 
                    time, weather, and proximity of the user, and communicates with the user.
                </p>
                <p><b>Movement</b><br>
                    The change in time is reflected by the shape of the light. 
                    This feature gives light a “physical property”, allowing the user to feel like this light 
                    is real and alive. Dynamic origami patterns enabled a more natural shape shifting and 
                    I was able to make a sphere. Fishing wire was tied to the top and rolled on a spool on 
                    the servo motor to create the flattening movement.
                </p>
                <p><b>Weather reading</b><br>
                    Theres more than brightness to light. 
                    With different hues light has, I wanted the light to speak to the users of today’s mood, 
                    or weather. Using a wifi module, I pulled in OpenWeatherAPI, an online weather API source. 
                    Reading the correct values from the data, I extracted keywords listed that described the weather. 
                    In the arduino, I read them through the serial terminal and separated them by type. 
                    Then, according to the value read, the color of the LED neopixel ring was set to change. 
                    This information reading was programmed to occur every 30 minutes.
                </p>
                <p><b>Proximity</b><br>
                    The user and the light interacts buy just the users presence, brightening as the user gets close, 
                    to elicit a feeling of excitement a companion might feel when they are greeted. 
                    3 infrared sensors in horizontal placement were used to get proximity data. 
                    According to which infrared sensor(left, right, or center) was within the threshold first, 
                    the animations of the light were differently programmed.

                <p><b>Practice makes improvement.</b>
                    As this was my very first time dealing with real. 
                    Physical materials and products, there were lots to be learned. 
                    The most difficult but absolutely rewarding part of this series of projects was 
                    to get the mechanisms to work. Trying out different materials and mechanisms to fail, 
                    but also to learn what didn’t work and what I can change was an especially valuable 
                    experience. Through these endless trial and errors, sleepless nights, and multiple 
                    trips to Ace’s Hardware, I was able to not only learn the skills of a physical 
                    prototyper, but also improve on my resilience and proactiveness as a designer.
