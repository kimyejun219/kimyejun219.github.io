            <div class="col-md-12">
                <h5>Problem</h5>
                <p>Music plays a very large part in an era where various contents are utilized. 
                    With the advent of the post COVID-19 era, musicians, pro and amateurs, 
                    have become to desire to release their creative outlet without physically meeting, 
                    as that has become almost impossible. Additionally, the digital transformation of 
                    getting used to remote environments and various non-face-to-face services is 
                    accelerating.</p>

                <p>Application encouraging remote methods of creating and stacking music. 
                    Jam is a service for musicians where they stack specific tracks on top of 
                    each other to create diverse music and monetize the music made.</p>

                <h5>Whiteboard Research</h5>
                <p>According to Youtube, music ranks the 2nd most consumed content in the world. 
                    Additionally with the outbreak of COVID-19, the concept or online ensembles have emerged.
                </p>
                <h5>Existing Platforms</h5>
                <p><b>Live Music</b><br>
                    With the outbreak of COVID-19, the way people interact, along with sharing music, 
                    has shifted to an online form. <br>
                    Through streaming platforms like Youtube or Twitch, streamers create live jamming 
                    sessions with a Japanese recording program called Syncroom. <br>
                    <b>What they lack:</b> Due to this being a live stream, the quality of sound is compromised 
                    and the profit is given to the streamers, not the musicians.
                </p>
                <p><b>Dubbing Culture</b><br>
                    Others utilize the idea of “dubbing”, where users download a video, 
                    stack their own video next to the original video, and upload it as their content. 
                    This phenomenon can also be seen in platforms like TikTok and instagram stories. <br>
                    <b>What they lack:</b> These platforms are also ambiguous in the split of profit and 
                    since there are a lot more videos aside from music-related, it is hard for musicians 
                    to find each other.

                <p><b>Become the user!</b>
                    As I had little knowledge about this culture, 
                    I was stumped on recognizing the pain points. One suggestion from a 
                    peer that really helped to going through with this project was to 
                    become to user myself.I immersed myself into the music creation 
                    culture by attending a live stream, searching through artists in 
                    Sound Cloud, and actually “dubbing” a video on TikTok myself. 
                    As a result, I was able to better understand some of the problems 
                    the users were having with the existing platforms.
                </p>
                <p><b>You are not the solver of all problems.</b>
                    At first, I tried to include everyone in the process. 
                    As a result, I was steering away from the focus and coming up with 
                    UI’s that was hard to recognize. However, realizing that I am not, 
                    and should not, be creating an “all-in-one” solution, 
                    I took a step back and re-examined my goals. By getting rid of the 
                    burden that this design should solve ALL problems, 
                    I was able to pin down on what was important for my focus users, 
                    musicians in this case.
